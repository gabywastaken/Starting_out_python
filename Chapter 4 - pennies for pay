#Pennies for pay

#Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over
#a period of time if his salary is one penny a day, 2 pennies the second day,
#and continues to double each day.
#The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing
#what the salary was for each day, then show the total pay at the end of the
#period

days = int(input("Number of days: "))
count = 0
total = 0

for dias in range(days):
    count +=1
    payment = count ** 2
    total += payment
    print(payment)
print("the total is", total)
