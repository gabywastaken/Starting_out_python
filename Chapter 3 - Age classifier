#Age classifier
#Write a program that asks the user to enter a person's age. The program should
#display a message indicating whether the person is an infant, a child,
#a teenager, or an adult. Following the guidelines:

#if the person in 1 yo or less, its an infant
#if the person is older than 1y, but younger than 13y, its a child
#if the person is at least 13y, but less than 20yo, its a teenager
#if the person is at least 20yo, its an adult

age = int(input("Age: "))

if age < 1:
    print("Infant")
elif age >= 1 and age <13:
    print("Child")
elif age >=13 and age < 20:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Adult")
