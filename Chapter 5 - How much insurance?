#How much insurance?

#Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes
#or buildings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the
#structure. Write a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of
#a building, then display the minimum, amount of insurance he or she should buy
#for the propery

    insurance_cost = ((cost_building * 80) / 100)
