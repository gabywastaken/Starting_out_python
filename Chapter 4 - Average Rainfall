#Average Rainfall

#Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average
#rainfall over a period of years. The program should first ask for the number
#of years. the outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will
#iterate twelve times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will
#ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations,
#the program should display the number of moths, total inches of rainfall, and
#and the average rainfall per month

rain_month = 0
control = 0
total_month = 0

print("---Welcome to average rainfall calculator---")

years = int(input("How many years?: "))
control = 0

#while control <= years:
for i in range(years):

    control += 1
    for month in range(12):
        rain_month += int(input("average rainfall this month"))

        total_month += 1


average_r = rain_month / total_month

print("Number of month: ",total_month, "--- total inches of rainfall: ",rain_month , "--- average per month: ",average_r)
