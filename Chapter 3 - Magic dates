#Magic dates
#The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following
#format, the month times the day equals the year:
#6/10/60
#Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day,
#and a two-digit year. The program should then determine wheter the month times
#the day equals the year.
#If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should
#display a message saying the date is not magic.
