#Area of rectangles
#The area of a rectngle is the rectangle's lenght times its width. Write a prog-
#gram that asks for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should
#tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same



len_rec1 = int(input("Lenght 1: "))
wid_rec1 = int(input("Width 1: "))

len_rec2 = int(input("Lenght 2: "))
wid_rec2 = int(input("Width 2: "))

rec_area1 = len_rec1 * wid_rec1
rec_area2 = len_rec2 * wid_rec2

if rec_area1 > rec_area2:
    print("The area of rectangle #1 is larger than rectangle #2")
else:
    print("The area of rectangle #2 is larger than rectangle #1")
