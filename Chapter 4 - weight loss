#Weight loss

#If a moderately active person cuts their calorie intake by 500 calories a day,
#they can typically lose about 4 pounds a month.
#Write a program that lets the user enter their starting weight, then creates
#and displays a table showing what their expected weights will be at the end
#of each moth for the next months if they stay on this diet

weight = int(input("Enter your weight: "))
loss = 4

for n in range(6):
    count += 1
    weight -= loss
    print(count, "---", weight)
