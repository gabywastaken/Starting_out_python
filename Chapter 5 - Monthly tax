def main():
    total_sales_month = int(input("Enter total monthly sales: "))

    county_pt = county_tax(total_sales_month)
    state_pt = state_tax(total_sales_month)
    total = total_tax(county_pt, state_pt)

    print("County sales tax: $", county_pt,
          "\nState sales tax: $", state_pt,
          "\nTotal sale tax: $", total)

def county_tax(total_sales_month):
    county_percent = (total_sales_month * 2.5)/100
    return county_percent

def state_tax(total_sales_month):
    state_percent = (total_sales_month * 5)/100
    return state_percent

def total_tax(county_pt, state_pt):
    sum_sales_tax = (county_pt + state_pt)
    return sum_sales_tax
