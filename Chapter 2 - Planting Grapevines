#Planting Grapevines

#A vineyard  owner is planting several new rows of grapevines, and needs
#to know how many grapevines to plant in each row. She has determined that
#after measuring the length of a future row, she can use the following
#formula to calculate the number of vines that will fit the row, along
#with the trellis end-post assemblies that will need to be constructed at
#each end of the row:
#V=R-2ES
#The terms in the formula are:
#V = is the number of grapevines that will fit in the row
#R = The length of the row, in feet
#E = the amount of space, in feet, used by an end-post assembly
#S = the space between vines, in feet

#Write a program that makes the calculations for the vineyard owner. The
#program should ask the user to input the following:
#- Lenght of the row in feet
#- Amount of spaceused by an end-post assembly in feet
#- The amount of space between the vines, in feet

#Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display
#the number of grapevines that will fit in the row.


print("----Grapevine calculator-----")

R = float(input("Lenght of the row (feet): "))

E = float(input("amout of space used by and end-post assembly (feet): "))

S = float(input("Space between vines (feet): "))

v_grapevines = (R - (2 * E ))/ S

print("The number of grapevines that will feet in the row: ", v_grapevines)
