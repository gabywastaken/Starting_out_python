#Color Mixer
#The colors red, blue, and yellow are know as the primary colors because they
#cannot be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you get
#a secondary color, as shown here:
#When you mix red and blue, you get purple.
#When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.
#When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
#Desing a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors
#to mix. If the user enters anything other than "red", "blue", or "yellow",
#The program should display an error message.
#Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary color that results.
