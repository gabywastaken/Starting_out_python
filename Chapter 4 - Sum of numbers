#Sum of numbers

#Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive
#numbers.
#The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. After
#all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the sum.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0

while num >= 1:
    count += num
    num = int(input("Enter a number again: "))

print(count)
