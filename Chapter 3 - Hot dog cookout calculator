#Hot dog calculator
#Assume hot dogs come in packages of 10, and hot dog buns come in packages of 8.
#Write a program that calculates the number of packages of hot dogs and the
#number of buns needed for a coockout, with the minimum amount of leftovers.
#The program should ask the user for the number of people attending the cookout
#and the number of hotdogs each person will be given. The program should display
#the following details:

#The minimum number of packages of hot dogs required
#the minimum number of packages of hot dog buns required
#The number of hot dogs that will be left over
#The number of hot dog buns that will be left over

#Info required from the user
atendees = int(input("How many atendees?: "))
hot_dogs_pp = int(input("How many hot dogs for each atendee?: "))

#Info of the materials
hot_dogs_quantity = 10
buns = 8

#quantity of hot dogs required to make for all the attendees
hotdogsneeded = atendees * hot_dogs_pp
hotdogsbunsneeded = hotdogsneeded

#number of packages we need to feed all the atendees
packagesofhotdogsneeded =(hotdogsneeded / hot_dogs_quantity)
packofbunsneeded =(hotdogsbunsneeded / buns)

hotdog_leftover = (hot_dogs_quantity * packagesofhotdogsneeded_ceil) - (atendees * hot_dogs_pp)
buns_leftovers = (buns * packagesofhotdogsneeded_ceil) - (atendees * hot_dogs_pp)

print("""For the party, youll need: \nHotdog packages: {} \nBuns packages: {} \nHot dogs Left: {} \nBuns left: {}""".format(packagesofhotdogsneeded_ceil, packofbunsneeded, hotdog_leftover, buns_leftovers))
