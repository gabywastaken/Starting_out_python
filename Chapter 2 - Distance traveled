#Distance Traveled
#assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that
#a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the
#following formula: Distance=SpeedxTime
#A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that
#displays the following:
#The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
#The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
#The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

distance1 = 70 * 6
distance2 = 70 * 10
distance3 = 70 * 15

print("{} \n{} \n{}".format(distance1, distance2, distance3))
