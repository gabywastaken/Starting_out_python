##Population

#Write a program that predicts the approx sixe of a population of organisms
#The application should use text boxes to allow the user to enter the starting
#number of organisms, the average daily population increase (%), and the number
#of days the organism will be left to multiply

start = int(input("Starting num of organisms: "))
avr = int(input("Average increase: "))
days = int(input("Number of days: "))
times = days-1
start1 = start
print(start)

count = 0

for n in range(times):
    count += 1
    perc = start1 * (avr/100)
    start1 += perc
    print(count , format(start1,".1f"))
