##Property tax
##
##A county collects property taxes on the asssessment value of property, which
##is 60 percent of the property's actual value. For example, if an acre of land
##is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000.
##The property tax is then 72cents for each 100 of the assessment value. The
##tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20.
##
##Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of property and
##displays the assessment value and property tax.
