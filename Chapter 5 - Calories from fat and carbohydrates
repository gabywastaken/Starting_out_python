##Calories from fat and carbohydrates
##
##A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members evaluating their diets.
##As part of her evaluation, she asks memebers for the number of fat grams and
##carbohydrates that they consumed in a day.
##Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the
##following formula:
##
##calories_from_fat = fat_grams * 9
##
##Next she calculates the number of caloris that result from the carbohydrates,
##using the following formula:
##
##calories_from_carbs = carb_grams * 4
##
##The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculations.
