Sales Tax
#Ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase. The program
#should then compute the state and county sales tax. Assume the
#state tax is 5% and the county sales tax is 2.5%. The program
#should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax
#the county sales tax, the total tax, the total of the sale
#(which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total
#sales tax)

price_purchase = float(input("> "))
state_tax = price_purchase * 0.05
price_stax = price_purchase - state_tax
county_tax = price_stax * 0.025
price_ctax = price_stax - county_tax

print("Amount purchased {} \nState tax {} \nCounty tax {} \nTotal {}".format(price_purchase, state_tax, county_tax, price_ctax))
