#Tip Tax and Total
#Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a
#restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food,
#then calculate the amounts of 18% tip, and 7% sales tax. Display each of these
#amounts and the total.

subtotal_price = float(input("Meal charge: "))

tip = (subtotal_price * 18) / 100

sales_tax = (subtotal_price * 7) / 100

total = format(((subtotal_price + tip) + sales_tax),'.2f')

print("Bill: \nsubtotal= {}\nTip= {}\nSales tax= {}\nTotal= {}".format(subtotal_price, tip, sales_tax, total))
