##Paint job estimator
##
##A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space,
##one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be  required. The company
##charges $35 per hour for labor.
##Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be
##painted and the price of the paint per gallon. The program should display the
##following data:
##    The number of gallons of paint requiered
##    The hours of labor required
##    The cost of the paint
##    The labor charges
##    The total cost of the paint job
