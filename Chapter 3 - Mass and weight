#Mass and weight
#Scientists measure an object's mass in kilograms and its weight in newtons. If
#you know the amount of mass of an object in kilograms, you can calculate its
#weight newtons with the following formula:
#weight = mass * 9.8
#Write a program that asks the user to enter an object's mass, then calculate its
#weight. if the object weighs more than 500 newtons, display a message indicating
#that is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 100 newtons, display a message
#indicating that its too light.

mass = int(input("Enter mass: "))

weight = (mass * 9.8)

if weight >= 500:
    print("The object is too heavy")
elif weight <= 100:
    print("The objects is too light")
else:
    print("Acceptable weight")
