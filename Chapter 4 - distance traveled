#Distance traveled

#The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
#Distance = speed x time
#Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour)
#and the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display
#the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period.

speed = int(input("Speed: "))
time = int(input("Time: "))

count = 0

while count < time:
    count += 1
    Distance = speed * count
    print(count, "   ", Distance)
