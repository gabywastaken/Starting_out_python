##Compound interest
##
##When a bank account pays compound interest, it pays interest not only on the
##principal amount that was deposited into the account, but also on the interest
##that has accumulated over time. Suppose you want to deposit some money into a
##savings account, and let the account earn compound interest for a certain
##number of years. The formula for calculating the balance of the account after
##specified number of years is:
##
##A=P(1+rn)nt
##
##the terms are:
##    A is the amount of money in the account after the specified number of years
##    P is the principal amount that was originally deposited into the account
##    r is the annual interest rate
##    n is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded
##    t is the specified number of yeas
##
##Write a program that makes yhe calculation for you. The program should ask the
##user to input the following:
##    The amount of principal originally deposited into the account
##    The annual interest rate paid by the account
##    The number of times per yeat that the interest is compounded (for example,
##    if interest is compounded monthly, enter 12)
##    The number of yeats the account will be left to earn interest
##
##Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display
##the amount of money that will be in the account after the specified number of
##years.
##

amount_principal = int(input("Principal amount: "))
anual_interest = int(input("Annual interest: "))
compounded_int = int(input("Months for compound interest: "))
years_account = int(input("Years the account will be left to earn interest: "))

amount_ater_years = (amount_principal * (1 + anual_interest * compounded_int) * compounded_int * years_account)

print("After ", years_account, " years, you'll have", amount_ater_years)
