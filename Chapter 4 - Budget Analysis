#Budget Analysis

#Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he has  budgeted for
#a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his expenses for the
#month and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should dis
#play the amount that the user is over or under the budget

budget = int(input("Budget: "))
amount = 0
control = 1

while control == True:
    amount += int(input("Expense: "))
    ask = input("Another one? ")
    if ask == "n":
        break

if amount <= budget:
    print("Congrats, the buget is ", amount)

else:
    print("Oh no, too expensive ", amount)
