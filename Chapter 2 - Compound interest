#Compound interest

#When a bank account pays compound interest, it pays interest not only on the
#principal amount that was deposited into the account, but also on the inteest
#that has accumulated over time.
#Suppose you want to deposit some money into a savings account, and let the
#account earn compound interest for a certain number of years. The formula
#calculating the balance of the account after a specified number of years is:

#A=P(1+rn)nt

#The terms in the formula are:
#A = The amount of money in the account after the specified number of years
#P = principal amount that was originally deposited into the account
#r = the anual interest rate
#n = is the number of times per year that interest is compounded
#t = the specified number of years

#Write a program that makes the calculation for you. The program should ask the
#user to input the following:

#- The amount of principal originally deposited into the account
#- The annual interest rate paid by the account
#- The number of times per year that the interest is compounded (Example, if the
#interest is compounded monthly, enter 12. If quarterly, enter 4.)
#- The number of years the account will be left  to earn interest

#Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display
#the amount of money that will be in the account after the specified number of
#years

P_principal = int(input("Please enter principal amount: "))

r_rate = int(input("Anual interest rate: ")) 

n_compound = int(input("Annual interest compound: "))

t_time = int(input("How many years: "))

r_rate /= 100

A = P_principal * ((1 + (r_rate * n_compound)) * (n_compound * t_time))
print("This is going to be the amount in your acount after {} years: {}".format(t_time, A))
