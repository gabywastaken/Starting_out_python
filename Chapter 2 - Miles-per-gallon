#Miles per gallon
#A car's miles-per-ga+llon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
#MPG= miles_driven/Gallons_of_gas_usd
#write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and
#the gallons of gas used. I should calculate the car's MPG and display the result

miles = float(input("Miles driven: "))
gallons = float(input("Gallons used: "))

MPG = float(miles / gallons)

print("Miles per gallon result: ",format(MPG,'.2f'))
